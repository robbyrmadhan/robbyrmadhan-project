**About This Project**

This project use 1990 California Census dataset to evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on data collected from houses in Californian districts. And use this model to predict median house value in Californian districts, also try to understand how the different attributes can impact the house prices.

This Project will divide in 2 main parts:
* take a deep dive in the data, clean it up, and make a Explanatory Data Analysis to gather insight and create hypotheses
* Create ML model capable of making the best possible prediction on the house prices
