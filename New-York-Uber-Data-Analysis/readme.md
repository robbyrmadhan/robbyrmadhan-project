# New York Uber Data Analysis


## Introduction

Uber is a transportation company with an app that allows passengers to hail a ride and drivers to charge fares and get paid and this is facing a lot of challenges both inside and outside. But, the demand for it never seems to slow down. I am saying this confidently because, in the last 5 years, people think twice before buying a car because of the ease with which they get a cab for any rides. This is evident from the slowdown in car sales across the world.
